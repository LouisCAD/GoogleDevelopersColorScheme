# Google Developers color scheme

This color scheme brings the [color scheme seen on Google Developers website](https://developers.google.com/nearby/messages/android/pub-sub#subscribe_to_messages) to Android Studio, and IntelliJ IDEA.

I like this one because it's a both **light** and **colorful** color scheme, and I made it show in favorite IDE.

##Why a light color scheme?
A light color scheme will reduce eyestrain, compared to a dark one. Why? On a dark background, your eyes will adapt to low light conditions, so your pupils will open wide to let more light enter your eye. Fine. But the bright text on the dark background will burn your retina (not forever hopefully) as more light is allowed to enter your eye, which will cause eyestrain after extended watching. On a light background, your eyes don't allow that much light to go in your eyes, but you'll still see where the light is missing, i.e. the text.
